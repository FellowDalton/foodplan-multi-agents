# =============================================================================
# Google OAuth Authentication Setup
# =============================================================================
# This application uses Google OAuth for authentication instead of email/password.
# No additional environment variables are required beyond the Supabase credentials above,
# but you MUST configure Google OAuth in your Supabase dashboard.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# 1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard (https://app.supabase.com)
#    Navigate to: Authentication > Providers
#
# 2. Find "Google" in the list of providers and click to configure
#
# 3. Enable the Google provider by toggling it ON
#
# 4. Configure your Google OAuth credentials:
#    - You'll need to create a Google Cloud Project at: https://console.cloud.google.com
#    - Enable the Google+ API for your project
#    - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
#    - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into Supabase
#
# 5. Set up Authorized Redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console:
#    Add this URL: https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
#    (Replace <your-project-ref> with your actual Supabase project reference)
#
# 6. In Supabase, configure the redirect URL for your application:
#    - For local development: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
#    - For production: https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
#
# 7. Save your configuration in Supabase
#
# TESTING:
# - Run your app locally and click the "Sign in with Google" button
# - You should be redirected to Google's login page
# - After successful login, you'll be redirected back to your app
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If you get "redirect_uri_mismatch" error, verify the redirect URLs match exactly
# - Make sure your Google Cloud Project has the correct authorized domains
# - Check that the Google+ API is enabled in your Google Cloud Project
# - Verify your Supabase project URL and keys are correct in this .env file
